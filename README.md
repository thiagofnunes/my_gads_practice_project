# My Google Africa Developer Scholarship Android practice project
# By Thiago Nunes
### I would like to apologize for some errors regarding the UI frames and some misplaced colors and items, I am a backend developer so my front-end can be pretty bad at times.

This project is a very simple Android Project aimed at getting me to implement some simple concepts that are very important as far as Android Development is concerned.

In this project, I managed to implement a mobile design of the GADS 2020 Leaderboard.
The mobile App displays Top 20 learners in the Learning Leaders’ category and Top 20 learners in the Skill IQ Leaders’ category.

This project made me implement:
1. Multi-Activity Project
2. View pager
3. Customizing Toolbar
4. RecyclerView
5. Making Network Request
6. Working with Google Form and many more...


### Screen 1 -> Splash Activity

Shows the logo a couple of seconds
